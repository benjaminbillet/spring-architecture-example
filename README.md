# spring-architecture-example

This is a Spring demo project for learning purpose. Each branch represents a step towards an application that demonstrates:
- gradle concepts
- spring boot
- a json-based rest API
- Java Persistence API metamodels + spring metamodel generation
- spring data repositories
- caching
- authentication using [JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io)
- access control
- async tasks
- a real-world architecture using a data access layer, services, data transfer objects, entity-dto mappers, view data objects, etc.
- websockets (TODO)

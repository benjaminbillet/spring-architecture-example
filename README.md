# SonarQube
[SonarQube](https://www.sonarqube.org) is a static code analyzer for detecting bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your code. It runs as a standalone application with a web interface: https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/setup/get-started-2-minutes

Use `./gradlew sonarqube` to run the analysis (reports are available in the web app).

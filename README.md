# Improvements of DTO-entity mappings
In the previous branch, we created a mapper for converting our DTO into entity and vice versa. This mapper is now autogenerated using [mapstruct](http://mapstruct.org/documentation/1.3/reference/html).

Look into `build/autogenerated` to see the code actually generated by mapstruct.

# Error management
[RFC7807 - Problem Details for HTTP APIs](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7807) standardizes a format for machine-readable details of errors in HTTP responses.

Any exception thrown by the program can be transformed into a proper response, thanks to the `my.app.config.ExceptionTranslator`. In `my.app.api.errors`, we create new exceptions that are translated into RFC7807 data structure to have properly detailed error responses. 

# JSON improvements
New modules are added to `JacksonConfiguration`:
- [Jackson afterburner](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-modules-base/tree/master/afterburner): generates bytecode for limiting the use of reflection, which improve the overall performances
- Hibernate datatypes serialization/deserialization direct support
